{"id":"uv-eg-3","title":"Fix PBR demo on iOS","description":"The PBR demo is not working correctly on iOS devices","notes":"PBR demo crashes on iOS but works fine on macOS.\n\nRoot cause: ColorSource.useResource() was calling .useResource() on textureCube and depth2D texture variants, which causes hangs/crashes on iOS (and depth2D hangs on macOS too).\n\nSolution: Only call .useResource() for texture2D variant in ColorSource. The textureCube and depth2D variants must be skipped.\n\nKey findings:\n- When using argument buffers with GPU resource IDs, you SHOULD still call .useResource() to declare resources\n- But only texture2D works reliably - textureCube and depth2D cause platform-specific issues\n- texture2D: works on both iOS and macOS ✓\n- textureCube: causes hang on iOS ✗\n- depth2D: causes hang on macOS and iOS ✗\n\nFixed in ColorSource.swift by commenting out the problematic useResource calls.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-10-17T10:38:55.838052-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-17T13:37:38.598262-07:00"}
